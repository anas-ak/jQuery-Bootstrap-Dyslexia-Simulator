  <h1>Dyslexia</h1>

  <p>Friends who have dyslexia described to me how they experience reading. 
	 She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to "jump around".</p>

  <p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia.</a> 
	 Wouldn't it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. <br />
	  This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, <br />
	  auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>

    <p>
      Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. <br />
	  Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders,
	  however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.
    </p>


    <p>
      Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency <br />
	  with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia <br /> 
	  (auditory, visual and attentional), 
	  although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying <br />
	  neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities 
	  (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.).
	  <br /> <br />
	  
      Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, 
	  dyslexia also affects <br /> one's expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition
      abilities.
